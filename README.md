**Description:**  
I am developing a Telegram bot that serves as a digital library, allowing users to search, browse, and access a collection of books directly through Telegram. The bot is built using **C++** with the `tgbot-cpp` library for Telegram API integration and utilizes **SQLite** for efficient storage and retrieval of book data.

**Key Features:**
- Search and browse books by title, author, or category
- Easy access to digital content within Telegram
- Fast and lightweight backend using C++ and SQLite

**Technologies:**  
`C++`, `tgbot-cpp`, `SQLite`

## 🎯 Interests & Goals
- Passionate about **studying algorithms, developing telegram bots and other useful software**
- Interested in **AI technologies** and the development of **intelligent tracking and control systems**
